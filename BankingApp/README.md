# Banking Application

# Description
Banking Apps have become extremely popular over the years and nowadays, there has been a surge in downloads of banking applications due to the ease and efficiency over regular banking. In addition to this, to benefit the environment, bank statements are now available to view on your app instead of being sent to you by post.

Banking is an important industry which is used by people of all abilities and a wide age range. Ensuring that customers are able to manage their money securely and with minimal difficulty is integral. Therefore, I think this is
a good interface to implement due to the high demand and use of banking apps.

Focal HCI matters which I wish to tackle within this interface are; navigation, usability, haptic feedback and responsiveness.

Tasks users would be able to carry out in this application(Functionality):
- View available balance in your account
- 'Pay/Transfer' a payee
- View transactions
- View contact methods
- 'Download' bank statement
- View help options
- Access settings and control notifications

# Installation

To create this interface I used Android Studio which is an Integrated Development for Android app development. It's a unified environment where you can build applications for all Android devices.  

Here is a video showing how to download and open the app on android Studio and open the emulator:
