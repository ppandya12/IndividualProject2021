# Banking Web Page 

# Description 
Banking website with a linked banking application. Online banking has become more and more popular over the years and 
nowadays, payments are all done using credit cards or services such as Apple pay. In addition to this, to benefit the 
environment, bank statements are now only found online instead of being sent to you by post. Banking websites are used 
by everyone and ensuring that users of all abilities are able to manage their money with minimal difficulty and securely 
is integral.  Therefore, I think this is a good interface to implement due to the high demand and use of banking apps. 

Focal HCI matters which I wish to tackle within this interface are; navigation, usability, responsiveness and colour theory.

Tasks users would be able to carry out (Functionality): 
- Log in to their account 
- Register/Open an account
- Select which account you want to access (Private, Public, Business and Co-operate)
- View products the bank offer (current accounts, credit cards, mortgages etc...)
- Contact a worker if they have any queries
- View other possible ways of accessing their banking information 
- View any Updates 
- View important information
- Search on the website
