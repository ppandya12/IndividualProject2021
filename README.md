# Medical Web Page 

# Description 
Medical clinic websites are essential and are used by a wide age range alongside people with different abilities.
Therefore ensuring that the web page itself is consistent, efficient, simple yet effective is crucial when creating this 
kind of interface. 

The main HCI issues which I will be focusing on with this interface are; human perception, usability, 
age/special needs issues and navigation.

Tasks users would be able to carry out (Functionality): 
- Log in to their account 
- View/Request Prescriptions 
- Book/Change/Cancel Appointments 
- View the medical centres opening times 
- Access Services 
- Contact the centre 
- Request for a member of the centre to contact them
- Register with a GP 
- View Important Updates 
- Search the website 

# Visuals 
- screenshots or video link?
