# Medical Web Page 

# Description 
Medical clinic websites are essential and are used by a wide age range alongside people with different abilities.
Therefore ensuring that the web page itself is consistent, efficient, simple yet effective is crucial when creating this 
kind of interface. 

The main HCI issues which I will be focusing on with this interface are; human perception, usability, 
age/special needs issues and navigation.

Tasks you can carry out on the interface: 
- Log in to their account 
- Logout of their account
- Book Appointments 
- View the medical centres opening times 
- Access Services
- View Screening information 
- Contact the centre 
- Request for a member of the centre to contact them
- View Important Updates 

# Visuals 
I uploaded a video to show you how the website works and looks.

# Installation/ How to Use 
On git hub, select the MedicalWebpage branch. Click on index.html, this will lead you to the homepage. On the homepage 
you can fill in a form if you would like the medical center to contact you. By typing in 'john' for the username and 
'smith' as the password, you will then be signed in (you will see the name john smith appear in the top right hand 
corner). If incorrect, you will be notified of this.  In addition to this, when you scroll down there is a grid of 4 
images, by clicking the book appointments button under the corresponding image, you will be able to 
access the book appointments page where you can fill in a form. This page can also be accessed by hovering over 
'appointments' in the nav bar -  a dropdown will appear, click on 'book Appointment'. 

Also on the nav bar you can hover over the services section on the nav bar and click on 'screening'. This takes you to 
the screening page where you can view the different screening services provided by the clinic. There are anchors to the 
different subsections on the page. When you are on a section of the page which isn't the top, a button appears. When the 
button is clicked it will take you back to the top of the page without having to scroll.
