<h2> <u> Screening </u> </h2>

<div class="info" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">

    <p> Screening is a way in finding out if an individual is at
        risk of a health problem. The earlier screening occur, the quicker we can offer treatment. Our team will support you
        through the entire process and will ensure that you are in a comfortable environment. Once the results are obtained
        an informed decision will be made in what the next steps will be. We aim to get the results back to you within a
        week. If you experience any issues please get in touch with us.<br><br>

        We carry out the following examinations, more information can be found below: <br><br>

        <h4> <u>Breast Cancer Screening </u> <a name="breastScreening"></a></h4>
            <p> This screening is offered to women aged 50 to 70 to detect early signs of breast cancer. Women over 70 can self-refer.
            About 1 in 8 women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. If it's detected early, treatment
            is more successful and there's a good chance of recovery.<br><br>

            Breast screening aims to find breast cancers early. It uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot cancers when
            they're too small to see or feel.<br><br>

            If you're worried about breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump or an area of thickened tissue in a breast, or you notice
                that your breasts look or feel different from what's normal for you, do not wait to be offered screening, see a GP. </p>

        <hr>

        <h4> <u>Bowel Cancer Screening </u> <a name="bowelScreening"></a></h4>
            <p>Everyone aged 60 to 74 is offered a bowel cancer screening home test kit every 2 years.<br><br>

            If you're 75 or over, you can ask for a kit every 2 years by phoning the free bowel cancer screening helpline on
            0800 707 60 60.<br><br>

            Regular bowel cancer screening reduces the risk of dying from bowel cancer.

            Bowel cancer is a common type of cancer. Screening can help find it at an early stage, when it's easier to treat.<br><br>

            <b><u>Bowel scope screening</u></b><br>
            Previously, some people aged 55 were invited for a test where a healthcare professional uses a tube with a camera to
            look inside the bowel. This is called bowel scope screening.<br>

            Bowel scope screening is no longer offered. If you were invited for this test but have not had it because it was delayed
            due to coronavirus, you will be sent a home test kit from April 2021.</p>

        <h4> <u>Prostate Cancer Screening </u> <a name="prostateScreening"></a></h4>
            <p>The PSA test can find aggressive prostate cancer that needs treatment, but it can also find slow-growing
                cancer that may never cause symptoms or shorten life. Some men may face difficult decisions about
                treatment, although this is less likely now that most men are offered an MRI scan before further tests
                and treatment.<br><br>

                Treating prostate cancer in its early stages can be beneficial in some cases, but the side effects of
                the various treatments are potentially so serious that men may choose to delay treatment until it's
                absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h4> <u>Heart Screening </u> <a name="heartScreening"></a></h4>
            <p>This screening involves the evaluation the heart structures by the use of ultrasound, or high frequency sound wave,
            which creates graphic images of the heart. The primary role of echocardiography in clinical practice is a non-invasive
            and costeffective answer to the structure and function of the heart muscle and valves. <br><br> There is no preparation required
            for the test, it takes approximately 20-30 minutes and is painless. <br><br>The Echocardiogram measures the Left Ventricular
            Ejection Fraction (LVEF) which is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts.</p>

    <hr>

        <h4> <u>Ultrasound Screening </u> <a name="ultraSound"></a></h4>
            <p>An ultrasound scan uses very high-frequency soundwaves to create pictures of the inside of your body. Soundwaves are
            very safe. They donâ€™t cause the same kind of damage as radiation or X-rays. <br><br>The scan is conducted with a special
            handheld device that will be passed over your skin. The probe or transducer sends out soundwaves and then collects the
            echoes that bounce back. These echoes are used to create a picture, in the same way that bats use soundwaves to see.
            The moving pictures will be displayed on a screen in real time. <br><br>Our doctors can look at a
            particular organ, blood vessel or part of your body. It is even possible to see how well your organs are functioning
                and how blood is moving along your veins and arteries.</p>
