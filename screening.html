    <!-- Summary of what the page consists of  -->
    <p> Screening is a way in finding out if an individual is at
        risk of a health problem. The earlier screening occur, the quicker we can offer treatment. Our team will support
        you
        through the entire process and will ensure that you are in a comfortable environment. Once the results are
        obtained
        an informed decision will be made in what the next steps will be. We aim to get the results back to you within a
        week. If you experience any issues please get in touch with us.<br><br>

    <h4><u>Breast Cancer Screening </u> <a name="breastScreening"></a></h4>
    <p> This screening is offered to women aged 50 to 70 to detect early signs of breast cancer. Women over 70 can
        self-refer.
        About 1 in 8 women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. If it's detected early,
        treatment
        is more successful and there's a good chance of recovery.<br><br>

        Breast screening aims to find breast cancers early. It uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot
        cancers when
        they're too small to see or feel.<br><br>

        If you're worried about breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump or an area of thickened tissue in a breast, or
        you notice
        that your breasts look or feel different from what's normal for you, do not wait to be offered screening, see a
        GP. </p>

    <h4><u>Bowel Cancer Screening </u> <a name="bowelScreening"></a></h4>
    <p>Everyone aged 60 to 74 is offered a bowel cancer screening home test kit every 2 years.<br><br>

        If you're 75 or over, you can ask for a kit every 2 years by phoning the free bowel cancer screening helpline on
        0800 707 60 60.<br><br>

        Regular bowel cancer screening reduces the risk of dying from bowel cancer.

        Bowel cancer is a common type of cancer. Screening can help find it at an early stage, when it's easier to
        treat.<br><br>

        <b><u>Bowel scope screening</u></b><br>
        Previously, some people aged 55 were invited for a test where a healthcare professional uses a tube with a
        camera to
        look inside the bowel. This is called bowel scope screening.<br>

        Bowel scope screening is no longer offered. If you were invited for this test but have not had it because it was
        delayed
        due to coronavirus, you will be sent a home test kit from April 2021.</p>

    <!-- Subsection -->
    <h4><u>Prostate Cancer Screening </u> <a name="prostateScreening"></a></h4>
    <p>The PSA test can find aggressive prostate cancer that needs treatment, but it can also find slow-growing
        cancer that may never cause symptoms or shorten life. Some men may face difficult decisions about
        treatment, although this is less likely now that most men are offered an MRI scan before further tests
        and treatment.<br><br>

        Treating prostate cancer in its early stages can be beneficial in some cases, but the side effects are
        potentially so serious that men may choose to delay treatment until it's absolutely necessary.</p>

    <h4><u>Heart Screening </u> <a name="heartScreening"></a></h4>
    <p>This screening involves the evaluation the heart structures by the use of ultrasound, or high frequency sound
        wave,
        which creates graphic images of the heart. The primary role of echocardiography in clinical practice is a
        non-invasive
        and costeffective answer to the structure and function of the heart muscle and valves. <br><br> There is no
        preparation required
        for the test, it takes approximately 20-30 minutes and is painless. <br><br>The Echocardiogram measures the Left
        Ventricular
        Ejection Fraction (LVEF) which is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it
        contracts.</p>

    <!-- Subsection -->
    <h4><u>Ultrasound Screening </u> <a name="ultraSound"></a></h4>
    <p>An ultrasound scan uses very high-frequency soundwaves to create pictures of the inside of your body. Soundwaves
        are
        very safe. They donâ€™t cause the same kind of damage as radiation or X-rays. <br><br>The scan is conducted with a
        special
        handheld device that will be passed over your skin. The probe or transducer sends out soundwaves and then
        collects the
        echoes that bounce back. These echoes are used to create a picture, in the same way that bats use soundwaves to
        see.
        The moving pictures will be displayed on a screen in real time. <br><br>Our doctors can look at a
        particular organ, blood vessel or part of your body. It is even possible to see how well your organs are
        functioning
        and how blood is moving along your veins and arteries.</p>
