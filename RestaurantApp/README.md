# Restaurant Application

# Description
This application enables users to look at the menu as well as order from the table. Especially
due to the current pandemic, applications like these are extremely popular and
must be very easy and efficient due to a wide range of demographics using it.
I think that creating such an app is very relevant due to our current
circumstances and also requires me to consider factors which I potentially
wouldnâ€™t  have prior to this situation. (e.g. information on rules in the
restaurant due to the new format).

I will focus on these particular HCI matters; haptic/tactile technology,
usability, feedback to user and human perception.


Tasks users would be able to carry out (Functionality):
- View Menu
- View discounts
- Order and Pay at your table
- Add items to basket
- Call waiter for assistance
- Enter promo codes
- Choose for food to appear ASAP instead of all together

# Installation
To create this interface I used Android Studio which is an Integrated Development for Android app development. It's a unified environment where you can build applications for all Android devices.

Here is a video showing how to download and open the app on android Studio:
